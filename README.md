# multivar-devel
Overview

This package has been made available to document the analyses carried out for a manuscript that asks the question, "Do aggregate, multimodal structural neuroimaging measures replicate regional developmental differences observed in highly cited cellular histological studies?" This package includes R scripts, MATLAB functions, and MATLAB scripts. Note that this package does not contain the software needed to process the imaging data used for these analyses and may not contain all software dependencies need to run the scripts and functions provided. The primary purpose of sharing the code provided in this package is to document the analyses that were performed in the preparation of the referenced manuscript. The code is provided as is, without documentation and without guarantee of usefulness or offer of technical support.
